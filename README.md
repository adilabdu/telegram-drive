#### Telegram Drive: File System

Backend for iOS, Android and Web Telegram Cloud Client, leverages the [Telethon API client library](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) to communicate with a user's "Saved Messages". 

This project builds API methods for a client-side React Native application and makes the files hosted in a logged in Telegram user's Saved Messages accessible.
